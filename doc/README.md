# DOCS

None yet but all the code has Markdown comments. Also, for all files ../src/x look inside for 

- any function that begins with `eg` (this is an example function)
- any function mentioned in a `@tests` list (at end of file)

ALso, for larger tests, some of the ../src/x files have a an associated set of tests in ../test/x.
